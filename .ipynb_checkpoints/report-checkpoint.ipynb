                "Traditional database systems often struggle with performance when dealing with large datasets, particularly for operations like searching, range queries, and maintaining sorted data. Linear search algorithms (O(n) complexity) become inefficient as data grows, leading to slow query response times and poor user experience. Additionally, many existing database solutions are complex and resource-intensive, making them unsuitable for lightweight applications or educational purposes.\n",

The B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree structure specifically designed for database systems and file organizations. It enhances performance in both disk-based and memory-based data management by optimizing search, insertion, and deletion operations with a logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)).\n",

This makes the system accessible to users without requiring programming knowledge while still serving as an educational tool for understanding B+ Tree operations."
